<h1 class="top">Aachen </h1>

<div class="content">
    <p class="content1">Aachen developed from a Roman settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Charlemagne, and, 
        from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans.</p>

        <p class="content1">The name Aachen is a modern descendant, like southern German Ach(e), German: Aach, meaning "river" or "stream", 
            from Old High German ahha, meaning "water" or "stream", which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds) 
            to Latin Aquae, referring to the springs</p>
